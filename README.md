> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Problematic Introduction**
> 
> The lunchtime rush at ESFOT poses a significant operational challenge.
> The influx of students seeking to order their meals within a limited timeframe (11 AM to 2 PM) results in the formation of long queues.
> These extended wait times not only inconvenience students but also negatively impact their overall dining experience.
> Additionally, the manual ordering process, with its inherent limitations, can lead to inefficiencies and potential errors.
> The existing system struggles to accommodate the high volume of orders during peak hours, leading to delays and frustration among students.
